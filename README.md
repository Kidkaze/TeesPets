Small Challenge project that focuses on a pet business that helps dogs and cats get re-homed.
The application focuses on:

- Adding predefined sample data to the pets array.
- Iterating a "menu options and user selection" code block to establish the outer loop of your application.
- Implementing code branches corresponding to the user's menu selections.
- Displaying all the information contained in the array used to store pet data (based on user's menu selection).
- Iterating an "add new animal information" code block that enables the user to add one or more new animals to the pets array (based on user's menu selection).
